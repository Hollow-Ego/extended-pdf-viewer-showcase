## Prequisites and announcement

*Breaking change*: 
Version 9.0 requires at least Angular 9. If you're using an older version of Angular, please use ngx-extended-pdf-viewer 8.x.
The idea is to support the four most current versions of Angular, which gives you roughly two years to update.


If you're familiar with Angular, you can get the PDF viewer up and running in roughly five minutes. You need node.js, npm and a current version of Angular. This library works out-of-the-box with any version since Angular 9. 


Install the library with `npm install`:

```batch
npm i ngx-extended-pdf-viewer --save
```

After that, it depends on how you created your library. I'll describe two approaches: the standard Angular CLI and JHipster.
