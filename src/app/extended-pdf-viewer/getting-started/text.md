## Prequisites

If you're familiar with Angular, you can get the PDF viewer up and running in roughly five minutes. You need node.js, npm and a current version of Angular. This library works out-of-the-box with any version since Angular 6. However, I only test it with Angular 7 and with the most current version.

Install the library with `npm install`:

```batch
npm i ngx-extended-pdf-viewer --save
```

After that, it depends on how you created your library. I'll describe two approaches: the standard Angular CLI and JHipster.
