  <h1>Range requests</h1>
  <p>
    Sometimes PDF files are large, even huge. By default, the PDF loader doesn't load the entire PDF file. Instead, it loads it in chunks.
    So it can display the first page while it's still loading the other pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the time, you don't have to configure this feature (unless you want to switch it off). It just works. If it doesn't, check if
    your server supports range requests. If it does, the response headers have the attribute <code>accept-ranges: bytes</code>.

  <p>Vishal Patel has written a article <a href="https://medium.com/@vishal1909/how-to-handle-partial-content-in-node-js-8b0a5aea216">range request</a>
    and how to implement them in a simple node.js server. He's also published the source code
    <a href="https://github.com/phoenixinfotech1984/node-content-range/blob/master/server.js">on GitHub</a>.</p>

  <h2>Getting rid of range requests and lazy loading</h2>
  <p>
    The <a href="/options">default options</a> <code> disableStream</code> and <code>disableAutoFetch</code> allow you to switch off the feature.
    In most cases, this means it takes longer until the PDF file is shown, so use this option only as a last resort.
  </p>
  <p><b>Caveat:</b> When I tried this, I didn't manage to disable range request. Chances are the feature is broken.</p>
