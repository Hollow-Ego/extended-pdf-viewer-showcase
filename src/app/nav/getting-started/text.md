## Prequisites and announcement

You can get the PDF viewer up and running in roughly two minutes. You need node.js, npm and a current version of Angular. This library aims to be compatible to the last four versions of Angular, which gives you two years time to update.

With very few exceptions, I only maintain the most current version of the viewer. As much as I'd like to provide bug fixes to older versions, I don't have enough time to spare.

## Just in case you haven't got an Angular project yet

The instructions below assume you've already got an Angular project. If you haven't, here's what to do:

- Install node.js. Make sure it's a current version with an even version number.
- Install the Angular CLI by running the command `npm i -g @angular/cli`.
- Create a new Angular app by running the command `ng new my-favorite-project`.

I've described these steps in more detail <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues/2010#issuecomment-1850778118">here</a>.
